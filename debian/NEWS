python-pip (23.0+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  This version of pip introduces PEP 668 support. Debian's python3.11
  interpreter will soon (>= 3.11.1-3) declare the installation to be
  EXTERNALLY-MANAGED, instructing pip to disallow package installation outside
  virtualenvs.

  See: https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/

  Practically, this means that you can't use pip to install packages outside a
  virtualenv, on Debian's Python interpreter by default, any more.

  You can override this behaviour by passing --break-system-packages to pip
  install, but be aware that if you are running pip as root, doing so can
  break your system.

  See /usr/share/doc/python3.11/README.venv for more details.
  If that isn't available yet, check:
